# Campus-Bookshop-Program
- Two months before the beginning of each semester, the Campus Bookshop produces a Purchase Requirements Report.
- This report details the books that have to be purchased for the coming semester.In the past this was done manually but now management have decided to computerise the operation. Accordingly, lecturers' requirements have been captured and the results used to update a Purchase Requirements File.
- This is a permanent file that contains details of the lecturers' book requirements for both semesters. 
- You are required to write a program to produce a Purchase Requirements Report from the Publisher, Book and Purchase Requirements files.The report should be sequenced on ascending Publisher Name and should only detail the purchase requirements for the semester under scrutiny.
- The semester number(1 or 2) should be accepted from the user at the start of the program using a simple ACCEPT and DISPLAY.
